# Security policy

At the moment, there are no known vulnerabilities in any version of Dream Displays. However, as the project evolves (especially when adding support for other platforms or custom video sources, like links) new security issues could arise.

In such cases, we will respond immediately and update this document with a list of:

- Versions fully supported
- Versions supported only with security fixes
- Versions that are no longer supported

Our policy is to provide support exclusively for the latest Minecraft version. Keeping the server fork and client
updated ensures access to new features and helps mitigate potential security risks.

If any features could pose a threat, they can be disabled by server admin until it's safe to use them (currently, no
such features exist).
