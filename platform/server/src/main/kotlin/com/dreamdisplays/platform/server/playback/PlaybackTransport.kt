 * The minimal platform surface the v2 playback backend ([TimelineManager], [WatchPartyManager])
 * needs. Implemented once per platform (`Paper` / `Fabric`) and injected at startup so the managers
 * themselves stay platform-agnostic. Everything here is v2-only — modes and watch parties never
 * degrade to frozen-v1, so there is no legacy path to mirror.
