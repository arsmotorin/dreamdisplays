 * only reaches it after the in-process fast path has declined or failed.
 *
 * Unlike [NewPipeResolver], this path can resolve any HTTP(S) URL `yt-dlp`'s extractors understand,
 * not just YouTube. It does not surface rich metadata (title, uploader, thumbnails) since
 * [YtDlp.fetch] only returns playable stream descriptors; only duration and live/seekable flags
 * carried on the streams are reported.
